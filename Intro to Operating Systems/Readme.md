Projects from CS 1550 - Intro to Operating Systems

These are projects completed in Linux from CS1550.  I unfortunately lost most of the project descriptions as well as the neccessary supporting files, but I have provided the bulk of the code I edited to complete the projects.

To my best assumption, these are the assignments.

1.) Adding new Syscalls to the kernel to utilize a Semaphore

2.) Implementing a Mutex Lock among multiple threads

3.) Virtual Memory Simulator (Description included)

4.) Implementing a file system
